# Job-Portal-
There is an admin dashboard from where admin can post a job for the candidate. These jobs are uploaded on the job portal, from where candidates can apply for the jobs which has been posted by the admin. In this project I have covered the front-end part with the help of Bootstrap and CSS, backend with PHP and MYSQL database.
